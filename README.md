# State-Factors-and-Race-on-COVID-19-Deaths
This analysis is used to gain a better understanding of the factors affecting the spread of COVID-19. This project explores the effects of 7 explanatory variables on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States using multiple linear regression. These 7 variables were chosen as literature on the topic has tended to find that these, and similar variables, were often the most important factors in determining the risk of COVID-19 spread. Additionally, the number of deaths appears to be the most accurate predictor of COVID-19 spread in the United States. Finally, this analysis is also concerned in finding if there is a disproportionate amount of deaths by COVID-19 for minority groups in the United States.
